What it means to create—

To make something convenient.
To make it accessible to anyone.
To make it simple.

To be there... always thinking of someone's safety.
To deliver security that reaches the heart... to be of use.

Even if they never realize how it works...
Creating with this in mind.
Creating with deep thought about what technology should be.

This is how it must be.
